The target of this example is try to get higher accuracy of nonMNIST dataset. the dataset and some of code is come from [this course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730)

## Code structure

### Create tfrecords for data.
nonmnist_data.py

prepare the dataset for this task




## Knowlege point

## tf.train.Estimator 
* model_fn => define a full-feature model_fn    
    *tf.train.EstimatorSpec
    
## [input_fn](https://tensorflow.google.cn/get_started/input_fn)

* implement a full-feature for training, evaluation, predict.
* put data process in to it.
